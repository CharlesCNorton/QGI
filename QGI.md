iSWAP-Z-iSWAP identity

H⊗H · iSWAP · Z⊗Z · iSWAP · H⊗H = I

This identity demonstrates that a specific five-gate sequence reduces to the identity operator. The operation begins with Hadamard gates applied to both qubits, performing a basis transformation from the computational Z-basis to the X-basis. An iSWAP gate exchanges the qubit states while introducing phase factors of i, followed by Z gates that flip the sign of the |1⟩ component on each qubit. A second iSWAP gate performs another state exchange with phase factors, and final Hadamard gates return the system to the computational basis. The net effect is that all unitary transformations cancel exactly, returning any input state |ψ⟩ to itself.
